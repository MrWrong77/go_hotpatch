# Plugin System

The `Plugins` folder contains the plugin manager (`plgmgr`) and demo plugins.

## Plugin Manager

`plgmgr` is a plugin manager that should be integrated into the main program.

## Demo

To run the demonstration:

```bash
./run_demo.sh
```

This demo showcases how plugins p1 and p2 replace functions and methods defined in the business package.

Plugin Configuration
The Plugins/plugin_version.json file defines plugin information, including names and versions.

Plugin Implementation
Each plugin should implement the following function:

```go
func Hook(m map[string]uintptr) {
    // m is a map of [functionName]functionPointer
    // It is passed by plgmgr and contains all functions in the main program
    // These function pointers are generated by the nm tool during initialization
    // Use this map to replace functions as needed
}
```
This Hook function is the entry point for each plugin to modify or replace functions in the main program.
